API Reference
Programmatic access to your account data. All endpoints are scoped to the authenticated user.

Authentication
Every endpoint requires a Bearer token sent in the Authorization header. Mint one above in the API Tokens card.

Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
Tokens are scoped to your account and grant read-only access to your own data.

API tokens
GET
/api/me/api-tokens
Copy
List your active API tokens. Raw token values are never returned — only metadata.

Response
JSON with a tokens array. Each entry has id, name, role, lastUsedAt, createdAt and expiresAt.

Example
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://duels.ink/api/me/api-tokens"
POST
/api/me/api-tokens
Copy
Mint a new Bearer token. The raw token is only returned in this response — store it safely.

Request body
Name	Type	Default	Description
name*	string	—	Token label, 1–64 characters.
expiresInDays	number	—	Optional expiry in days (1–365). Omit for non-expiring.
Response
JSON with success: true and a token object containing id, name, rawToken, createdAt and expiresAt. Max 10 tokens per user.

Example
curl -X POST "https://duels.ink/api/me/api-tokens" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"analytics-notebook","expiresInDays":90}'
Rate limit: 6 creations / 60s per user.

DELETE
/api/me/api-tokens
Copy
Revoke a token by id. The token stops working immediately. Cannot be undone.

Request body
Name	Type	Default	Description
id*	string	—	Id of a token belonging to the caller.
Response
JSON with success: true.

Example
curl -X DELETE "https://duels.ink/api/me/api-tokens" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":"<token-id>"}'
Data export
GET
/api/me/match-history
Copy
Stream one analytics-friendly row per finished game played by the authenticated user. Pure Postgres — does not touch the replay/log object store. Puzzle and playground games are never returned.

Query parameters
Name	Type	Default	Description
format	'csv' | 'json' | 'jsonl'	json	Response format. CSV and JSONL stream rows; JSON wraps them with a next_cursor field.
limit	number	1000	Rows per request, 1–1000.
cursor	string	—	Pagination cursor: "<iso-updated-at>|<game-id>". Read from next_cursor or the Link header.
from	ISO 8601	—	ISO 8601 timestamp — inclusive lower bound on games.updatedAt.
to	ISO 8601	—	ISO 8601 timestamp — exclusive upper bound on games.updatedAt.
source	'matchmaking' | 'private' | 'bot'	all	Comma-separated list. Default: all three.
queue	string	—	Comma-separated queue ids. Only constrains matchmaking rows.
Response
JSON: games array of MatchHistoryRow plus a next_cursor field (string or null). JSONL: one row per line. CSV: header row + one row per game. CSV/JSONL paginate via the Link header. Each row carries the player's and opponent's aggregated decklist as an array of cardId/count entries (sorted by cardId; JSON-encoded in CSV cells, structured arrays in JSON/JSONL).

Example
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://duels.ink/api/me/match-history?format=csv&from=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&to=2025-12-31T23:59:59Z" \
  -o match-history.csv
Rate limit: 20 requests / 60s per user.

POST
/api/me/bulk-replays
Copy
Return a manifest of direct download URLs for the requested replay_id values. Ownership is validated server-side. The caller fetches each URL itself — the app server is not in the byte path of the export.

Request body
Name	Type	Default	Description
ids*	string[]	—	Array of replay ids. Max 1000 per request.
Response
JSON with a files array (each entry has id, filename, url) and a missing array of ids the caller does not own or whose replay isn't ready.

Example
curl -X POST "https://duels.ink/api/me/bulk-replays" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ids":["rp_abc","rp_def"]}'
Rate limit: 30 requests / 60s per user.

POST
/api/me/bulk-gamelogs
Copy
Return a manifest of direct download URLs for the requested game_id values. Same design as bulk-replays — only finished games are returned.

Request body
Name	Type	Default	Description
ids*	string[]	—	Array of game ids. Max 1000 per request.
Response
JSON with a files array (each entry has id, filename, url) and a missing array of ids the caller does not own.

Example
curl -X POST "https://duels.ink/api/me/bulk-gamelogs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ids":["g_abc","g_def"]}'
Rate limit: 30 requests / 60s per user.

Direct downloads
GET
/r/{replay_id}
Copy
Download a single replay file. Server validates ownership, then redirects (302) to a signed CDN URL. The blob is immutable, so the CDN response is cached aggressively after the first warm fetch.

Response
302 redirect to a signed CDN URL serving the .replay.gz blob.

Example
curl -L -O -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://duels.ink/r/<replay_id>"
Notes: Authenticate via session cookie or Bearer token. Follow redirects (-L with curl).

GET
/g/{game_id}
Copy
Download a single gamelog file. Same redirect-to-signed-URL behaviour as /r/.

Response
302 redirect to a signed CDN URL serving the .logs.gz blob.

Example
curl -L -O -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://duels.ink/g/<game_id>"
Notes: Authenticate via session cookie or Bearer token. Follow redirects (-L with curl).
